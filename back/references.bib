abstract = {Modulo scheduling is a framework within which a wide variety of algorithms and heuristics may be defined for software pipelining innermost loops. This paper presents a practical algorithm, iterative modulo scheduling, that is capable of dealing with realistic machine models. This paper also characterizes the algorithm in terms of the quality of the generated schedules as well the computational expense incurred.},
